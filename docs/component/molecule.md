# Molecule

Molecule is a library from cashapp, which can write business logic in Compose, and it's also Kotlin Multiplatform project. For more information: https://github.com/cashapp/molecule

# Why Molecule with PreCompose
Since Molecule does not include any Lifecycle and Navigation state management, PreCompose can help you to integrate Molecule with Lifecycle and Navigation.

# Usage

## Flow Action

You can write a Presenter like this:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun CounterPresenter(
    action: Flow<CounterAction>,
): CounterState {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

    action.collectAction {
        when (this) {
            CounterAction.Increment -> count++
            CounterAction.Decrement -> count--
        }
    }

    return CounterState("Clicked $count times")
}
```
in your Compose UI, you can use this `CounterPresenter` with `rememberPresenter`
```kotlin
val (state, channel) = rememberPresenter { CounterPresenter(it) }
```
`state` is the instance of `CounterState`, which return by `CounterPresenter`, and `channel` is the instance of `Channel<CounterEvent>`, you can send event to `CounterPresenter` by `channel.trySend(CounterEvent.Increment)`

The molecule scope and the Event Channel will be managed by the ViewModel, so it has the same lifecycle as the ViewModel.

You can nest your Presenter by using `rememberNestedPresenter`

## State Action

If you prefer using State Action, you can write a Presenter like this:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun CounterPresenter(): CounterState {
    var count by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
    return CounterState("Clicked $count times") {
        when (it) {
            CounterAction.Increment -> count++
            CounterAction.Decrement -> count--
        }
    }
}
```

in your Compose UI, you can use this `CounterPresenter` with `producePresenter`
```kotlin
val state by producePresenter { CounterPresenter() }
```
